### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Daniel
A computer science student with an addition interest in mathematics.

### Programming Languages
- Python - my main/preferred language as seen from my profile
- Java - strong in Java and have used it within the context of three different university courses.
- C++ - (and C) have used for competitive programming (self study) and then later in one of my university courses
- SQL - comfortable writing queries with SQL (from a university course )
- Javascript - I'm familiar with native javascript/html/css (self study) but prefer using React.js (also self study)

## What my projects are about
- alot of the projects are just maifestations of my interest in different areas of computation
- some are just proof of concept from an idea that I have
- others are just me trying to learn or aquire a deeper understanding about some technology

## Most impressive project?
- from a standpoint of logical complexity, it would be my [modular arithetic sorting compiler](https://github.com/DanielStoi/short-projects/blob/master/modular_arithmetic_sorting_compiler.py) although it's less than 100 lines of code
- as a feat of software engineering a [python flask webapp](https://github.com/DanielStoi/visual_and_audio_media_webapp) as part of a group project
