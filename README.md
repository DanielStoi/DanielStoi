### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Daniel
A computer science student with an addition interest in mathematics. 

### Programming Languages
- As seen from my profile, my main/preferred language is Python
- However, Im also strong in Java and C (and intermediate level at C++)
- I'm comfortable writing queries with SQL
- Im also familiar with native javascript/html/css but prefer using React.js

## What my projects are about
- alot of the projects are just maifestations of my interest in different areas of computation.
- some are just proof of concept from some idea that I have.

## Most impressive project?
- from a standpoint of logical complexity, it would be my [modular arithetic sorting compiler](https://github.com/DanielStoi/short-projects/blob/master/modular_arithmetic_sorting_compiler.py) although it's less than 100 lines of code. 
- as a feat of software engineering [a webapp](https://github.com/DanielStoi/visual_and_audio_media_webapp) as part of a group project.
