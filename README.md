### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Daniel, A computer science student

 I've made an effort to keep all my [repositories](https://github.com/DanielStoi?tab=repositories) in a presentable form with detailed README's containing screenshots of the different functionalities. I generally do not post my school projects as it often requires explicit permission. I also tend not to show my smaller projects or experiments, although some of my earlier projects are in my [short projects repository](https://github.com/DanielStoi/short-projects).


### Programming Languages
- Python - my main/preferred language as seen from my profile
- Java - strong in Java and have used it within the context of three different university courses.
- C++ - (and C) have used for competitive programming (self study) and then later in one of my university courses
- SQL - comfortable writing queries with SQL (from a university course )
- Javascript - I'm familiar with native javascript/html/css (self study) but prefer using React.js (also self study)

## What my projects are about
a lot of the projects are just manifestations of my interest in different areas of computation
- some are just proof of concept from an idea that I have
- others are just me trying to learn or acquire a deeper understanding about some technology
